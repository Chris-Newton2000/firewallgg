# Override Codes
Override codes are built for larger databases that need to use a certain structure from their API for calling. These are usually self integrated by the repository owner themselves.

## Current codes:
- NONE = Disregard Override
- STR_FORCE = Stop The Resellers
- STT_FORCE = Stronger Together
- HBDB_FORCE = Hyperz Ban DB (Product)
