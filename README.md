This is technically the second version of FirewallGG. Originally it was created with the same intention, however it never succeeded and required many rewrites. Now, it has been rewritten in a more stable fashion with better intentions towards serving the community.

# How it works
FirewallGG is **both** *client sided* and *server sided*. What this means is users on any platform can now use FirewallGG to it's fullest capabilities. From a backend database background check on users, to a website for ease of access anywhere, all the way out to a desktop process that will allow you to run user Ids and get a return on them easily.

## Step One - Pick a method
First, you need to find out just which method will best suit your needs for using FirewallGG. If you're just trying to check a users background history, maybe just the website or the desktop process will be enough for you, but if you're looking for something a little more backend wise, possibly the [Node Module](https://npmjs.com/package/firewallgg) will be more your style. If none of these suit your needs, you can always just use our REST API [here](https://firewall.hyperz.net/api).

So again, your options are:
- The [Website](https://firewall.hyperz.net).
- The [Desktop Process](https://github.com/Itz-Hyperz/firewallgg/releases).
- The [Node Module](https://npmjs.com/package/firewallgg)
- The [Web API](https://firewall.hyperz.net/api).

## Step Two - Use / Integrate
For the basics, using the [Website](https://firewall.hyperz.net) or the [Desktop Process](https://github.com/Itz-Hyperz/firewallgg/releases) is pretty straight forward. Simple open one and enter a Discord User Id.

On the other hand, integrating it into your system may be a little bit more difficult. Most of our target audience uses FaxStore. So, if you're looking to easily integrate, look no-further than our built-in FaxStore extension that can be found [here](#input).

Yet, if you are entirely on your own, feel free to reference our public documentation for our Node Module [here](https://npmjs.com/package/firewallgg) or for our Web API you can look [here](https://firewall.hyperz.net/api).

## API Object Structure
Below is what gets returned from the physical API and you need to build your API endpoint to return a JSON object with these values as the *only returning values*.

```json
{
  "active": yourObject.active,
  "userid": yourObject.userid,
  "reason": yourObject.reason,
  "proof": yourObject.proof,
  "time": yourObject.time
}
```

Upon creating a pull request to add to the [`databases.json`](https://github.com/Itz-Hyperz/firewallgg/blob/main/databases.json) file, you will *also* need to provide a screenshot of what *exactly* gets returned from that API endpoint on your end, this way developers can verify that these data types are correct with no excess-hassle.
